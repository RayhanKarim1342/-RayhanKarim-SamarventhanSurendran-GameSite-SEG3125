              Memorize exactly where each item is placed on the shelf before
              time runs out. Place back the items carefully as fast as you can
              for the highest score. Be careful though! Placing an item in the
              wrong place will net you double the points lost for if you had
              placed the item in the correct place.

              the shelf into their correct location! Be careful though, once you
              place an item into a spot you cannot move it again.

              Your score is based on how many items are correctly placed on the
              shelf and is also dependent on how quickly you are able to put the
              items back on the shelf. Not just memory is put to the test but
              also speed!

              Choose from different difficulty levels, higher difficulty levels
              will give you less time to memorize the items on the shelf. If
              youâ€™re a Memory Wizard you will not only have less time but also
              more items to memorize! Prove yourself worthy by netting a perfect
              score on the Memory Wizard difficulty.
